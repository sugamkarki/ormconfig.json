# ormconfig.json


## How to use!!??

Install as a dev-dependency on a particular project:
```
yarn add -D ormconfig.json
npx ormconfig.json
```

Install globally(recommended if you are using typeorm very often):
```bash
yarn global add ormconfig.json
# now you don't have to prefix this command with npx!
tsconfig.json
```
